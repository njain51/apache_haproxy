# VirtualHost

more info [here](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/vhosts/examples.html)

- it provides  ability to serve content for multiple domains using the same server.
- Shared web hosting is the most common place to find this type of configuration. As it's very cost effective to be able to serve content from multiple domains from the same server, rather than setting up an entire server for each domain.
- Apache provides two types of virtual hosting. 
 
 
**Name-based virtual hosting** routes requests based on the domain names applied by the client, which is usually the browser. This is the easiest kind of virtual hosting to implement but presents challenges for SSL, as the server doesn't know which certificate to be using

**IP-based virtual hosting** requires a separate IP address for every site. This solves the SSL certificate problem but is more cost prohibitive and has more technical overhead.


example: 
```text
# Ensure that Apache listens on port 80
Listen 80
<VirtualHost *:80>
    DocumentRoot "/www/example1"
    ServerName www.example.com

    # Other directives here
</VirtualHost>

<VirtualHost *:80>
    DocumentRoot "/www/example2"
    ServerName www.example.org

    # Other directives here
</VirtualHost>
```

## Show parsed vHost settings:
