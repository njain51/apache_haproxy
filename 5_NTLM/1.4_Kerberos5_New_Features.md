# Kerberos5 New Features:

- To correct the deficiencies in the Kerberos 4 protocol, several new features were added. They include:
  - A better wire protocol 
  - Credential forwarding and delegation 
  - Replay cache 
  - More flexible cross-realm authentication 
  - Extensible encryption types 
  - Pre-authentication

- These additional features and refinements to the Kerberos protocol ensure its continued success as the most widely implemented single-sign-on authentication protocol

## Other products:

- **The Distributed Computing Environment , or DCE,** 
  - is a set of libraries and services that enable organizations to build cross-platform, integrated computing environments. 
  - It includes components that enable applications to communicate across a diverse set of platforms and securely locate and access information, whether itâ€™s in the same room on a local network or across the globe over the Internet
  - **DCE provides many services to make this possible, including directory services, remote procedure calls, and time-synchronization**. 
  - Most notable to our discussion, it provides a security service, which just happens to be based on Kerberos 5.
