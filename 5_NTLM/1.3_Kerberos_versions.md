# Kerberos Versions

- **Early Kerberos (v1, v2, v3)**
  - The early versions of Kerberos (pre-Version 4) were created and used internally at MIT for testing purposes
- **Kerberos 4**
  - The first version of Kerberos distributed outside of MIT was Kerberos 4. 
  - released to the public on January 24, 1989
  - However, due to export control restrictions on encryption software imposed by the U.S. government, Kerberos 4 could not be exported outside of the United States. 
  - Since Kerberos 4 uses DES encryption, organizations outside of the U.S. could not legally download the Kerberos 4 software as-is from MIT
- **Kerberos 5**
  - Kerberos 5 is the latest version of the Kerberos protocol and is documented in RFC 1510.
  - Unfortunately, while the rules surrounding encryption export out of the United States have been relaxed on open source software as of January 2000, the MIT distribution is still available to U.S. residents only.
