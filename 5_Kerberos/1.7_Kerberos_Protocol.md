# Kerberos5 Protocol

- The Kerberos 4 protocol had its share of shortcomings: it had a rather obtuse structure and it wasnâ€™t expandable, since many of its fields had fixed sizes
  - This limitation led to other problems, most notably the dependence on single-DES encryption keys
  - At the time that Kerberos 4 was developed, a brute-force attack against DES was still prohibitively expensive in terms of both resources and time. As computer speed continues to grow exponentially, it is now within the realm of well-funded adversaries to mount a brute-force attack against DES. Therefore, a more secure encryption algorithm with a longer encryption key size is needed.

- Another feature that users and administrators alike demanded from a new version of Kerberos was support for credential forwarding and delegation.
  - Credential forwarding enables users to transfer their tickets to a remote server once they are authenticated to it

- In order to create an extensible protocol that can be implemented on multiple platforms by multiple vendors, and ensure that all these implementations can interoperate, the Kerberos development team chose to use a technology known as ASN.1 to describe their new Kerberos 5 protocol.
- The Kerberos 5 protocol is under constant revision and development. The Kerberos home page at http://www.kerberos.isi.edu is the official home of the Kerberos Clarifications,
